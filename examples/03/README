64 atom FCC crystalline single component Lennard-Jones. Sigma = 2.0 for a
typical chemical bond-like characteristic length. Epsilon = 10.0 to prevent
melting at T=0.1. Generates the NPT ensemble using an isotropic MTTK barostat witha NHC thermostat of length 5.

THe simulation is stable, but the structure changes from the intial FCC crystal
to something else, but I'm not sure what the stable structure for a single
component Lennard-Jones system is at finite temperature. The lattice parameter
is smaller than expected from the equation of state, and the stress components
are anisotropic. Note that it is sensitive to the pair potential cutoff.

Visualise xsf trajectory using (assuming vmd is in your $PATH):

vmd -e view.vmd

Analyse the trajectory, skipping the first 1000 steps with:
