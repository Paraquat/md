64 atom FCC crystalline single component Lennard-Jones. Sigma = 2.0 for a
typical chemical bond-like characteristic length. Epsilon = 10.0 to prevent
melting at T=0.1. Generates the NVT ensemble using a Nose-Hoover chain of length 5 (still not sure about the masses).

Running md without any command line arguments will default to looking for the
file 'md.in'.

md > md.out

Visualise xsf trajectory using (assuming vmd is in your $PATH):

vmd -e view.vmd

Analyse the trajectory, skipping the first 1000 steps with:

md_analysis.py --skip 1000
